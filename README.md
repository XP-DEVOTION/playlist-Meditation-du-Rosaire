# YouTube + GitHub-as-a-Content-Hub



1\. Set up your GitHub account
------------------------------

1.  **Create an account:** Go to GitHub and sign up with your email.
    
2.  **Choose a simple username:** Ideally something close to your channel or brand name.
    
3.  **Turn on two‑factor authentication:** Protects your work and collaborations.
    

2\. Create a repository for your channel
----------------------------------------

1.  **Click “New repository.”**
    
2.  **Name it:** Something like my-youtube-channel or your channel name.
    
3.  **Set visibility:**
    
    *   **Private** if it’s just for you/your team.
        
    *   **Public** if you want to share scripts, templates, or resources.
        
4.  **Check “Add a README file.”** This will be your “home page” for the repo.
    

3\. Structure your content folders
----------------------------------

In your repo, create folders like:

*   /scripts — video scripts, podcast outlines, spoken‑word pieces
    
*   /thumbnails — thumbnail notes, design references, maybe exported images
    
*   /ideas — raw ideas, future series, brainstorm notes
    
*   /captions — YouTube descriptions, title tests, tag lists
    
*   /assets — logos, intros/outros, brand colors, fonts (or links to them)
    
*   /automation — any tools, templates, or code you use later
    

You can create these folders directly in GitHub via **“Add file → Create new file”** and ending the name with / (e.g., scripts/).

4\. Add your first content
--------------------------

1.  **Upload existing files** (scripts, notes, etc.):
    
    *   Click **“Add file → Upload files.”**
        
    *   Drag and drop your .md, .txt, .docx, or .pdf files.
        
2.  **Or create new files directly in GitHub:**
    
    *   Click **“Add file → Create new file.”**
        
    *   Name it like scripts/episode-01-intro.md.
        
    *   Paste your script or outline.
        
    *   Scroll down and **“Commit changes.”**
        

5\. Use commits as your creative history
----------------------------------------

Every time you change something:

1.  **Edit the file** (script, caption, etc.).
    
2.  At the bottom, write a short commit message like:
    
    *   Tightened hook for Episode 3
        
    *   Updated thumbnail notes for productivity video
        
3.  Click **“Commit changes.”**
    

Now you have a **timeline** of your creative process.You can always go back to older versions if you regret a change.

6\. Use branches to experiment safely
-------------------------------------

Let’s say you want to try a new style of intro or a new series.

1.  **Click the branch dropdown** (usually says main).
    
2.  Type a new branch name like new-intro-style or season-2-format.
    
3.  Click **“Create branch.”**
    
4.  Make your changes (scripts, structure, etc.) on this branch.
    

If you like the experiment:

1.  Click **“Compare & pull request.”**
    
2.  Review changes.
    
3.  Click **“Merge pull request.”**
    

If you don’t like it—just delete the branch. Your main workflow stays clean.

7\. Use Issues as your content task list
----------------------------------------

1.  Go to the **“Issues”** tab.
    
2.  Click **“New issue.”**
    
3.  Create tasks like:
    
    *   Write script for Episode 10
        
    *   Design thumbnail for “Morning Routine” video
        
    *   Research SEO for Lent series
        
4.  Add labels like:
    
    *   script
        
    *   thumbnail
        
    *   editing
        
    *   upload
        
    *   research
        

Now GitHub is your **content to‑do list**.

8\. Use Projects as your production board
-----------------------------------------

1.  Go to **“Projects”** in your repo.
    
2.  Create a new project (Board view).
    
3.  Add columns like:
    
    *   **Ideas**
        
    *   **Writing**
        
    *   **Filming**
        
    *   **Editing**
        
    *   **Scheduled**
        
    *   **Published**
        
4.  Link Issues to the board and drag them across as you progress.
    

This becomes your **production pipeline**, similar to Trello/Notion—but integrated with your files and history.

9\. Centralize your branding
----------------------------

In /assets, add:

*   **Brand colors:** maybe a brand.md file with hex codes
    
*   **Logo files:** .png or .svg
    
*   **Intro/outro notes:** scripts, timing, music cues
    
*   **Lower‑third templates:** text and style notes
    

Now, whenever you or a collaborator needs branding info, it’s all in one place.

10\. Collaborate with editors, designers, or writers
----------------------------------------------------

1.  Go to your repo → **“Settings” → “Collaborators.”**
    
2.  Invite your editor, designer, or co‑writer by email or username.
    
3.  They can:
    
    *   Edit scripts
        
    *   Upload thumbnails
        
    *   Comment on changes
        
    *   Work on branches
        

You get full visibility into **who changed what and when**.

11\. (Optional) Use GitHub Pages for creator resources
------------------------------------------------------

If you want a simple site for:

*   media kit
    
*   link‑in‑bio
    
*   brand guidelines
    
*   resource hub
    

You can:

1.  Go to **“Settings” → “Pages.”**
    
2.  Choose a branch (often main) and folder (like /docs).
    
3.  Add simple .md or HTML files in that folder.
    

GitHub will turn it into a small website—free and fast.

12\. Keep it simple and consistent
----------------------------------

You don’t have to use every feature on day one.

Start with:

*   **One repo**
    
*   **Folders for scripts, ideas, and assets**
    
*   **Simple commits when you update things**
    

Then gradually add:

*   Issues → for tasks
    
*   Projects → for workflow
    
*   Branches → for experiments
    
*   Collaborators → for your team
